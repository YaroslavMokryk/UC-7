UC_7.Tests Documentation
This repository contains a comprehensive suite of tests for the classes StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer within the namespace UC_7. These tests ensure the expected behavior of the classes and their methods under a variety of conditions, as well as their ability to handle edge cases and exceptional scenarios.

StudentConverter Tests
The StudentConverter class has a method ConvertStudents() that takes in a list of Student objects and returns a modified list of Student objects, with additional properties set based on their Grade and Age. The method is covered by six tests, which verify its behavior under normal operation, boundary cases, and edge cases, including handling of null inputs. These tests ensure that the method correctly sets properties such as Exceptional, HonorRoll, Passed, and also validates its response when an empty list or a null value is passed.

PlayerAnalyzer Tests
The PlayerAnalyzer class has a method CalculateScore() that takes in a list of Player objects and calculates a score based on each player's Age, Experience, and Skills. The method is covered by six tests which verify the score calculation for normal players, junior players, senior players, multiple players, and also check its behavior when an empty list or a player with null Skills is passed. These tests ensure that the method correctly calculates scores and can handle exceptional scenarios, including handling of null inputs.

Running the tests locally
To run these tests locally, you need to follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that you have .NET Core installed (version 3.1 or later is recommended).
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Use the command dotnet test to run the tests. The output will show the results of each test.
For example:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo
dotnet test
The dotnet test command will build the project and run all the tests. The test runner will provide real-time output of each test's result and a summary after all tests have been run.

If you wish to run a specific test, you can use the --filter option followed by the test method's name. For example, to run the CalculateScore_NormalPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore test, you would use:

bash
Copy code
dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~UC_7.Tests.PlayerAnalyzerTests.CalculateScore_NormalPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore

Make the description shorter, just 4-10 sentences would be enough.

UC_7.Tests Documentation
This documentation outlines the tests for the StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer classes within the UC_7 namespace. The StudentConverter class is tested for its ability to process student information and correctly assign labels such as Exceptional, HonorRoll, and Passed. The PlayerAnalyzer class is tested for its ability to calculate scores based on player attributes. Each test ensures the methods are robust against both typical and edge case scenarios, including handling of null inputs.

Running the tests locally
To run the tests locally, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory in the terminal, and use the dotnet test command. Ensure you have .NET Core installed. To run a specific test, use the --filter option followed by the test method's name. For instance: dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~UC_7.Tests.PlayerAnalyzerTests.CalculateScore_NormalPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore.
