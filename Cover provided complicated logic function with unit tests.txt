Using C# with the xunit test library, create tests for the following Calculate score method in the PlayerAnalyzer class:

namespace UC_7
{
    public class Player
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public int Experience { get; set; }
        public List<int> Skills { get; set; }
    }
}

namespace UC_7
{
    public class PlayerAnalyzer
    {
        public double CalculateScore(List<Player> players)
        {
            double score = 0;

            foreach (var player in players)
            {
                double skillsAverage = player.Skills.Sum() / (double)player.Skills.Count;
                double contribution = player.Age * player.Experience * skillsAverage;

                if (player.Age < 18)
                {
                    contribution *= 0.5;
                }

                if (player.Experience > 10)
                {
                    contribution *= 1.2;
                }

                score += contribution;
            }

            return score;
        }
    }
}

Cover following test cases
Positive Test Cases:
Case 1: Normal Player
Given an array with a single player object with age 25, experience 5 years, and skills [2, 2, 2], the function should return a score of 150 (since 2552 = 150).
Case 2: Junior Player
Given an array with a single player object with age 15, experience 3 years, and skills [3, 3, 3], the function should return a score of 67.5 (since (1533)*0.5 = 67.5).
Case 3: Senior Player
Given an array with a single player object with age 35, experience 15 years, and skills [4, 4, 4], the function should return a score of 1008 (since (35154)*1.2 = 1008).
Case 4: Multiple Players
Given an array with multiple player objects, the function should return the sum of their scores.
Negative Test Cases:
Case 1: Skills is null
Given an array with a player where Skills property is null, the function should throw an error
Case 2: Empty Array
Given an empty array, the function should return 0 (since there are no players to contribute to the score).

To create the test cases, we will utilize xUnit's Fact and Theory attributes for defining test methods. Here's how you would do it:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UC_7;
using Xunit;

namespace UC_7.Tests
{
    public class PlayerAnalyzerTests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void CalculateScore_NormalPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore()
        {
            // Arrange
            var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
            var players = new List<Player>
            {
                new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } }
            };

            // Act
            var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

            // Assert
            Assert.Equal(150, result);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void CalculateScore_JuniorPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore()
        {
            // Arrange
            var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
            var players = new List<Player>
            {
                new Player { Age = 15, Experience = 3, Skills = new List<int> { 3, 3, 3 } }
            };

            // Act
            var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

            // Assert
            Assert.Equal(67.5, result);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void CalculateScore_SeniorPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore()
        {
            // Arrange
            var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
            var players = new List<Player>
            {
                new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } }
            };

            // Act
            var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

            // Assert
            Assert.Equal(1008, result);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void CalculateScore_MultiplePlayers_ReturnsExpectedScore()
        {
            // Arrange
            var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
            var players = new List<Player>
            {
                new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } },
                new Player { Age = 15, Experience = 3, Skills = new List<int> { 3, 3, 3 } },
                new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } }
            };

            // Act
            var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

            // Assert
            Assert.Equal(150 + 67.5 + 1008, result);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void CalculateScore_SkillsIsNull_ThrowsException()
        {
            // Arrange
            var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
            var players = new List<Player>
            {
                new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = null }
            };

            // Act & Assert
            Assert.Throws<ArgumentNullException>(() => playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void CalculateScore_EmptyArray_ReturnsZero()
        {
            // Arrange
            var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
            var players = new List<Player>();

            // Act
            var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

            // Assert
            Assert.Equal(0, result);
        }
    }
}
Please note that in the case of CalculateScore_SkillsIsNull_ThrowsException you will need to handle the null case in your CalculateScore function. You should check for nullity before accessing the Skills list to avoid a NullReferenceException. If Skills is null, you could throw an ArgumentNullException or handle it in a way that makes sense for your use case. Currently, the code doesn't handle this case, so the test as written expects

Tests for NormalPlayer, SeniorPlayer and MultiplePlayers are failing becaues they have wrong values. These test cases actually return values of 250, 2520 and 2837.5 respectively.
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're correct. The CalculateScore function uses the following formula to calculate the score:

makefile
Copy code
contribution = age * experience * average_of_skills
For the NormalPlayer case, the correct score is 25 * 5 * 2 = 250.
For the SeniorPlayer case, it's 35 * 15 * 4 * 1.2 = 2520.
And for the MultiplePlayers case, the total would be the sum of the scores for the normal player (250), the junior player (67.5), and the senior player (2520), which is 2837.5.

Here are the corrected test cases:

csharp
Copy code
[Fact]
public void CalculateScore_NormalPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore()
{
    // Arrange
    var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
    var players = new List<Player>
    {
        new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } }
    };

    // Act
    var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(250, result);
}

[Fact]
public void CalculateScore_SeniorPlayer_ReturnsExpectedScore()
{
    // Arrange
    var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
    var players = new List<Player>
    {
        new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } }
    };

    // Act
    var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(2520, result);
}

[Fact]
public void CalculateScore_MultiplePlayers_ReturnsExpectedScore()
{
    // Arrange
    var playerAnalyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
    var players = new List<Player>
    {
        new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } },
        new Player { Age = 15, Experience = 3, Skills = new List<int> { 3, 3, 3 } },
        new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } }
    };

    // Act
    var result = playerAnalyzer.CalculateScore(players);

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(250 + 67.5 + 2520, result);
}
I apologize for the oversight and thank you for your patience.
